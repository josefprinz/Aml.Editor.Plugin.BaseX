# Aml.Editor.Plugin.BaseX

This repository contains the source code for an AutomationML Editor plugin that will allow to edit AutomationML documents from a BaseX database. This is a current development and I will report about its progress in my [blog](https://josefprinz.github.io/automationml/2022/12/29/AutomationML-BaseX-Plugin/). Currently you will only get an empty window.
